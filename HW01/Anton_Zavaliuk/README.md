~~Informal information~~

**Hi there, I believe, that you read this :)**

Sorry, that I've sended my homework on weekend, I think, you can check it next week.

So, just a few words about my implementation:

1. I've tried to make not elementary programs to print only answer, but also I've tried to make them not too hard to code.
2. In second and third tasks I've used unittests, I think it is the best way to have fun and learn how it works.
3. I'd like to use not standart convention for commits in git, which is quite useful for its first word in commit, main features you can find here: https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/
4. But if you do not like implementation with tests and function to calculate every degree, I can rewrite my code in easier case.

Thanks for reading. I believe, that your eyes is still great, 'cause my English is not too great))

**Have a nice day!**
