## HW01

- use `Ruby >= 2.6`
- please create fork from the https://github.com/labs-ruby/homeworks-2020
- then create a new branch (for example `my_hw_01`)
- and go to the directory to `HW01`
- create a folder with your name `Name_Surname`
- inside the folder create a file .rb for every task, for example `name_surname_hw_01_t_01.rb`
- for task 2, should be `name_surname_hw_02_t_02.rb` etc...
